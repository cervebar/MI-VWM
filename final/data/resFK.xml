		<name>Spectral Centroid Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>The centre of mass of the power spectrum.
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>

		<parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
	</feature>
	<feature>
		<name>Compactness Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>A measure of the noisiness of a signal. Found by comparing the components of a window's magnitude spectrum with the magnitude spectrum of its neighbouring windows.
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>
